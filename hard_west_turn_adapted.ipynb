      "  The man went to find something, not knowing what. This law was for the sake of students and faculty members only since the state attorney general ruled that it did not apply to non-students and non-faculty on campus who could carry concealed without restriction on campus. Relatives described him as a recluse with no friends. He shot the students and teacher in the classroom where he had formerly attended sessions. About a half-hour later, tactical teams entered the building. The proposed restrictions to amend regulations would not apply to stabilizing braces used by individuals with disabilities. There was one survivor, an infant girl. In accordance with law, the names of victims and witnesses were redacted or withheld.\n",
      "  The man remembered a lot of things. Then, as his mother lunged at him, he shot her once in the head and twice in the chest.\n",
      "  The man had many thoughts, few of them clear. Rescues of people trapped inside the nightclub commenced and continued throughout the night. After engaging in a shootout with police, he committed suicide inside the building.\n",
      "  The man preferred to eat alone, facing a window. He got into his truck and he found work as a mover.\n",
      "  The man knew that people said things, sometimes for no reason. Was arrested minutes later in his car outside the cinema. He remained standing for a few seconds before turning around and leaving. All three would attend counseling sessions for over nine months. Prior to the purchase he had similarly obtained several other firearms, including at least one shotgun and several other rifles.\n",
      "  The man remembered a lot of things. Among the dead were two brothers and a married couple. Arrived at the departmental event at about 8:30 a.m. and left midway through it at around 10:30 a.m., leaving a backpack atop a table. These calls were made during the first ten minutes of the shooting, and had to be released in the form of transcripts after a judge deemed them too graphic to be released as audio recordings.\n",
      "  The man had regrets. The report stated that he descended into a world where his only communication with the outside world was with members of a cyber-community, a small community of individuals that shared his dark and obsessive interest in mass murder. The synagogue describes itself as a traditional, progressive, and egalitarian congregation. Thirteen registered students were inside.\n",
      "  The man did not escape the country or himself.\n",
      "  The man carried an envelope of remembrances, sealed shut through pressure. His truck carried him and he found work as a mover.\n",
      "  To forget what had been taken away, the man thought on what he knew. Police officers using this tactic are trained to move toward the sound of gunfire and neutralize the shooter as quickly as possible.\n",
      "  The man had regrets. The immediate dead comprised 58 victims—36 women and 22 men—all of whom died from gunshot wounds. The poorly constructed devices failed to explode. Bomb technicians immediately examined the bombs and relayed to police at the school the possibility of devices with motion activators. Islamophobia is being spread around the world. I did a terrible thing that day. He had called police to a possible robbery at a liquor store and offered to lead the responding officer to where he had last seen the suspect. Both countries warned their citizens to avoid any place with large crowds, including shopping malls, festivals, and any kind of cultural or sporting events.

      "  The man had many thoughts, few of them clear. He shot both of them to death. Plans were to completely renovate the building and for it to no longer contain classrooms. Fired more shots and left the building through a side exit. According to press reports, he seemed dazed and largely unaware of his surroundings. He also heard many people yelling and many gunshots over the intercom while he, his classmates, and his teacher took refuge in a closet in the gymnasium. In 2006 psychiatrists testified that he was psychotic, delusional and irrational.\n",
      "  The man had many thoughts, few of them clear. However, this bus never arrived, and whether the comments from police stemmed from miscommunication or were an attempt to give distraught parents hope is unknown.\n",

According to several students, he looked into several classrooms, likely to see how many people were in each room.\n",
      "  The man had regrets. The couple continued to exchange fire with police from inside their vehicle. The company responded with a statement that the video had enough news or documentary context to remain, regardless of the violence shown.

A number of family members expressed support for the plans as necessary and long overdue, while a few doubted whether they would reduce gun violence. He was 88 years old at the time of his death. Used portable radio to notify police the siege was over. The couple was not completely successful in destroying their personal electronics, including mobile phones and hard drives, prior to the attack.

Survivors, including students and teachers, reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. She ran out, holding the baby in her arms. You loved inducing cancer in my head, terror in my heart and ripping my soul all this time.\n",
      "  The man did not escape the country or himself. He fired at the police once with a handgun as he lay wounded on the ground, injuring an officer before the gun malfunctioned. At the age of 18, he began working as a common laborer, which he continued until his death. The university was suddenly on the defensive. They then walked between the computer rows, toward the windows facing the outside staircase. A total of 603 calls to 911 were made by victims, family members and friends of victims, bystanders, and rescue workers during the entire shooting. The fuel did not explode because jet fuel is mostly kerosene, which is unlikely to ignite when struck by a bullet.\n",
      "  The man had regrets.\n",
      "  The man always had a tendency to watch, listen, and say little. He drove off in his truck and he found work as a night watchman.\n",
      "  The man thought to himself a good deal. Such offenders often self-radicalize from a volatile mix of personal distress, psychological issues, and an ideology that can be sculpted to justify and explain their anti-social leanings. The response to how gun laws affected the shooting was divided. Initially pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him. The total count of deaths was 12 students (14 including the shooters) and one teacher; 20 students and one teacher were injured as a result of the shootings. At 2:34 p.m., a dispatcher started informing responding officers of an active shooter situation at the store. I didn't hear him say a word, he just turned and fired.\n",

It consists of a park-like dell with 83 abstract birds, one for each victim. Additionally, some employees were desensitized to the intruder alert system, as it was almost always used for incidents of an undocumented migrant in the area running from police.

      "  There was no avoiding the insistent sayings of the television. He got into his truck and he found work as a night watchman.\n",
      "  Some things were beyond the man’s ken. They bought six propane tanks on the morning of the attack. About 20 minutes into the film, he left theater 9 through an emergency exit door beside the movie screen, with direct access to the lightly used parking area at the back of the complex, while propping the door slightly open with a plastic tablecloth holder. You bastards opened the door for all the women!\n",
      "  The man had regrets. Thirty minutes before the attack, they made a final video saying goodbye and apologizing to their friends and families. Was a relief carrier, meaning he was often required to work alternate routes on different days, a position dictated by his rank on the seniority list. The security guard had been killed by the shooter.\n",

      "  The man knew that some things said were fake, some facts. A minute later, he closed the trunk and began opening fire. Each of these people had so much love, talent and gifts to offer, and their lives were cut short by a horrible and senseless act. And certainly, we're not going to make sense of the killing of children. The door locked already. I would not presume to know anything about the victims of the shooting but that they were there last night to watch a movie.\n",
      "  Some things were known with certainty. He was said to have confessed his crimes to her. In response to the shooting, some 8chan users claimed that the shooter was our guy.

Two propane bombs were used in the cafeteria, two in the shooters' cars, and in another location intended as a diversion.\n",
